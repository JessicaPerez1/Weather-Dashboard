## The Weather Dashboard

### What I did

``
Using a 3rd party API - OpenWeather API - the user is able to access weather data for the city they search. They will then have access tu current weather - including temperature, uv index, humidity, windspeed and an icon representing the weather- and forecast for the next 5 days. Thanks to localstorage, the past cities searched are stored and appear in a list of past citites searched, available for the user to click again and access information.
